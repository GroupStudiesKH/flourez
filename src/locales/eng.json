Because when selecting sealing materials, it's not just about the operating environment - service life is often an important selection point. Regardless of which fluoroelastomer product, each has its own environment where it performs well and corresponding fatigue characteristics. FFKM still has its irreplaceability in terms of cleanliness, service life, and temperature and chemical resistance. For selection, we often recommend customers discuss with manufacturers, as necessary testing is often more efficient than written text. Only by applying suitable materials in suitable application ranges can we achieve balance between economic considerations and expected usage conditions.

    "ffkmIntro": "Chemical Composition: FFKM consists of a fully fluorinated backbone similar to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), giving it excellent chemical resistance and high-temperature resistance. Its unique molecular structure includes perfluoroalkyl ether groups, enhancing its flexibility and high-temperature performance. Molecularly, unlike FKM fluoroelastomers, in FFKM perfluoroelastomers, all carbon atoms in the main chain or side chains are bonded to fluorine atoms. This advanced composition ensures FFKM's integrity and performance in extreme environments. In terms of elastomer crosslinking structure, it can be divided into Peroxide-cure and Nitrile-cure. From a basic functional perspective, it can be categorized into chemical resistant, high-temperature resistant, and high purity types. Through compound formulations, products can be further developed to meet different application requirements, such as passing NORSOK M-710/ISO23936-2 certification, or complying with USP Class VI and FDA regulations.",

    "pflsIntro": "Perfluorinated liquids (PFLs) are colorless, odorless, non-toxic, thermally stable, and chemically inert perfluorinated fluids. Due to their molecular structure where carbon atoms form tight bonds with fluorine atoms, fluorinated liquids have excellent stability, do not react with active materials such as metals, plastics, and elastomers, and are extremely stable. They also have excellent non-conductive and insulating properties at both high and low temperatures. The more well-known perfluorinated liquids in the market are probably Solvay®'s Galden® and 3M®'s Fluorinert®. However, due to their oligopolistic nature, prices are relatively less affordable. Fluorinated liquids are extremely suitable for many single-phase heat transfer applications in semiconductor and electronic component manufacturing industries, replacing traditional conductive refrigerants and water. Fluorinated liquids have a working temperature range of -60°C to 165°C, suitable for equipment such as etchers, ion implanters, gross leaking test equipment's high and low-temperature tanks, and impact testing. PFLs are highly volatile with no residue, and their non-conductive properties also make them suitable for electronic component cleaning. Fluorinated liquids have zero ozone depletion potential. They are not restricted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are not subject to volatile organic compound regulations, and do not contribute to surface ozone formation causing environmental damage.\n\nPerfluorinated Liquids (PFLs) Features:",
